React and Redux

Build a React component and learn how to manage state locally at the component level, and throughout the entire application with Redux.

Different/non-accumulating code was used through each step; main.jsx contains the code in the current step.

Libraries are included to the code "behind the scenes" by freeCodeCamp where needed.
