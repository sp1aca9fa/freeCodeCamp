Learn how to create different React components, manage data in the form of state props, use different lifecycle methods like componentDidMount, and much more.

Different/non-accumulating code was used through each step; main.jsx contains the code in the current step.

Libraries are included to the code "behind the scenes" by freeCodeCamp where needed.
